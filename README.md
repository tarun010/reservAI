## Technologies
- Frontend: Flask with Jinja2 templating, Bootstrap for styling
- Backend: Flask, SQLAlchemy for ORM
- AI/ML: TensorFlow, scikit-learn
## Features
- Predictive Wait Time Estimation: Uses machine learning to predict wait times based on historical data.
- User Interaction: Allows users to join the waitlist, view current wait times, and receive notifications.
- Resource Optimization: Optimizes resource allocation based on predicted demand.

## Future Plans

### Scaling on AWS
To meet increasing demand, we plan to scale the wAItless platform using AWS. Here’s how:

1. **Infrastructure as Code**: Utilize AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to manage and provision AWS resources efficiently.
2. **Web Hosting**: Deploy the Flask application on Amazon EC2 instances. Use Auto Scaling Groups to adjust the number of instances based on traffic.
3. **Load Balancing**: Implement Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
4. **Containerization**: Use Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) or Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) to manage Docker containers for the application.
5. **Serverless Functions**: Implement AWS Lambda for specific tasks to run code without provisioning servers.
6. **Database Management**: Use Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) for SQL databases and Amazon DynamoDB for NoSQL databases to ensure low-latency performance at scale.
7. **Object Storage**: Store data such as uploaded CSV files in Amazon S3 for high availability and durability.
8. **Data Analytics**: Use Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce) and AWS Glue for processing large datasets and ETL operations.
9. **Security and Compliance**: Implement AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), AWS Shield, and AWS WAF to ensure the security and compliance of the platform.
10. **Monitoring and Logging**: Use Amazon CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail to monitor the infrastructure and application performance.

### Expanding to Other Businesses
We aim to expand our solution to various industries that face long lineups and queues, such as:

- **Bars and Restaurants**: Manage customer wait times efficiently.
- **Concerts and Events**: Optimize ticketing and entry processes.
- **Airline Check-ins**: Streamline the check-in process to reduce wait times.

### Prioritization Based on Business Needs
Our platform will allow businesses to prioritize individuals based on their criteria:

- **Healthcare**: Clinics and emergency rooms can prioritize patients based on the severity of their conditions.
- **Restaurants**: Restaurants can prioritize customers based on their own methods, such as loyalty programs or reservation times.

By using a weighted AI model, we can incorporate these priorities into our wait time predictions, ensuring an optimized and fair system for all users.
